          <p style = "text-align:center; font-size:20px; color:#7f0000; "> I am a student at St. Francis High School in La Canada. 
              I'm interested in technology, weather it be its history or its development. 
              I take many AP and Honors classes but that does not stop me from joining yearbook and being co-president of the
              St. Francis Robotics Team. I enjoy playing video games, working on computers, weather
              it be coding or building a computer. I also enjoy watching TV,
              Such as Game of Thrones and The Office.
